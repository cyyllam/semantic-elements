      <h2>What are semantic elements?</h2>

        <p>
          Semantic elements are HTML elements that provide clear meaning to the developer and the computer browser.
          They are an alternative to ones that may not intuitively describe its purpose.
          <code>form</code> and <code>table</code> are examples that convey a clear meaning of the content unlike unsemantic elements such as <code>div</code> and <code>span</code>.
          Overuse of <code>div</code>, <code>class</code>, and <code>id</code>  (a.k.a <a href="https://csscreator.com/divitis">divitis</a>) can be avoided by using semantic elements in lieu of unsemantic ones.
        </p>
          By using semantic elements you can enhance the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Accessibility, allowing assistive technologies to help those who may have impairments</li>
          <li>Searchability, allowing computers to understand and find the content</li>
          <li>Internationalization, allowing a global standardized language for progammers</li>
          <li>Interoperability, allowing other programs to understand the structure</li>
        </ul>
