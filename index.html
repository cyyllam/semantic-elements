        <p>
          These are HTML elements that provide clear meaning to the developer and the computer browser.
          They are an alternative to elements that may not intuitively describe its purpose.
          Form and table are examples that convey a clear meaning of the content unlike unsemantic elements such as div and span.
          Overuse of div, class, and id (a.k.a <a href="https://csscreator.com/divitis">divitis</a>) can be avoided by using semantic elements in lieu of unsemantic ones.

          By using semantic elements you can enhance the following:
          <ul>
            Accessibility, allowing assistive technologies to help those who may have impairments
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Searchability, allowing computers to understand and find the content
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Internationalization, allowing a global standardized language for progammers
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Interoperability, allowing other programs to understand the structure
          </ul>
